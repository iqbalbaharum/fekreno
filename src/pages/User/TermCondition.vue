            <p> Welcome to Kaggle. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), 
            products, services and applications (the “Services”). 
            If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these Terms or the Services, please contact us. 
            These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and Kaggle Inc. (“Kaggle,” “we” and “us”). 
            You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. 
            Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. 
            These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy. 
            In these Terms, the words “include” or “including” mean “including but not limited to”, 
            and examples are for illustration purposes and are not limiting. </p>
            <p class="text-h6"> Will these Terms ever change? </p>
            <p> We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, 
            but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the www.kaggle.com website, by sending you an email, or by some other means. </p>
